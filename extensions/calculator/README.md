### Unit Converter Usage

To use the unit converter command, you must follow this format:

```
[number] [from-unit] [connector-word]? [to-unit]?
```
When you only write `[number] [from-unit]` it will show you all the available units. For example, `120 m` or `10 km/h`

If you targeting specific unit you can either write 

```
[number] [from-unit] [to-unit]
``` 
or 

```
[number] [from-unit] [connector-word] [to-unit]
```

format, the `[connector-word]` ("to", "as", "in") is optional. For example, `120 m cm` or `120 m to cm`
